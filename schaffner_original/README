To install:
gcc -o hmm -g -lm -Wall hmm.c translate.c


extract_vcf.pl uncompresses a vcf file and pulls out variants into a seq.txt file. (scriptVCF_IBD.py is my version)
hmm.c is the only one that is pertinent. This is the actual script


from steve:
The first script uncompresses the VCF file and pipes the results to the script that pulls out variants. hmm.c is the HMM, which needs a little utility routine in translate.c.
